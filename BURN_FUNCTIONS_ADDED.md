# 🔥 Burn Functions Added to LUV Contract

## ✅ **New Burn Functions Implemented**

### **1. Manual Burn Function**
```solidity
function manualBurn(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
```

**Purpose**: Allows the team to manually burn tokens from their own balance
- **Access**: Only owner can call
- **Source**: Owner's wallet balance
- **Destination**: Dead address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`)
- **Effect**: Permanently reduces circulating supply

### **2. Contract Burn Function**
```solidity
function burnFromContract(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
```

**Purpose**: Allows the team to burn accumulated fee tokens from the contract
- **Access**: Only owner can call
- **Source**: Contract's fee balance
- **Destination**: Dead address (`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`)
- **Effect**: Reduces contract's accumulated fees and total supply

## 🔒 **Security Features**

### **Access Control**
- ✅ **Only Owner**: Both functions restricted to contract owner
- ✅ **No Public Access**: Cannot be called by anyone else
- ✅ **Proper Validation**: Amount must be positive and sufficient balance required

### **Dead Address**
- ✅ **Standard Dead Address**: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`
- ✅ **Permanent Burn**: Tokens sent here are permanently lost
- ✅ **Verifiable**: Dead address is publicly known and trackable

### **Supply Tracking**
- ✅ **Local Supply Update**: `_localTotalSupply` is properly decremented
- ✅ **Reflection Accuracy**: Maintains correct reflection calculations
- ✅ **Event Emission**: `TokensBurned` event for transparency

## 📊 **Use Cases**

### **Team Token Management**
